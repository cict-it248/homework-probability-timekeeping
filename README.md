# Probability and Time Keeping System in Games
***

## The Challenge
Using GD Script create the necessary codes that will implement damage and healing calculations to the character's health bar. A critical damage calculation should be also implemented based on the value of the critical probability box. Damage/Heal calculations can also be modified using a time keeping system. The basic damage calculation and full heal implementation is already done for your team to serve as a guide. **Be creative**.
